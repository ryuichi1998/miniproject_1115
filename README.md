Group Prjoect on datascience using TMDB and IMDB

### Grading Scheme
- 10%  for coming up with an interesting problem based on your dataset
- 10%  for data extraction, curation and/or joining based on the problem
- 10%  for data preparation and cleaning to suit the problem of your choice
- 10%  for exploratory data analysis/visualization to gather relevant insights
- 10%  for the use of machine learning techniques to solve specific problem
- 10%  for the presentation of data-driven insights and recommendations
- 10%  for the quality of final presentation (video) and overall impression
- 10%  for learning something new and trying something beyond the course

### Project Outline
- Scraping a dataset : The first step is to build a rich data set. We will collect textual and visual data for each movie.
- Data pre-processing
- Non-deep Machine Learning models</b> : Probabilistic and Max-Margin Classifiers.
- Intuitive theory behind Deep Learning
- Deep Models for Visual Data
- Deep Models for Text
- Potential Extensions
- Food for Thought

### Questions to Ponder
- Which actors are bound to a genre, and which can easily hop genres?
- Is there a trend in genre popularity over the years?
- Can you use sound tracks to identify the genre of a movie?
- Are top romance actors higher paid than top action actors?
- If you look at release date vs popularity score, which movie genres have a longer shelf life?
- Predict genre of movie based on the cast
- Predicting film's revenue and user rating
- Predict lists of recommended movie
- Predict movie rating due to change of cast
- Predict profit of movie in the pre production phase

### Ideas to explore specifically for feature correlations:
- Are title length correlated with movie genre?
- Are movie posters darker for horror than for romance end comedy?
- Are some genres specifically released more often at a certain time of year?
- Is the RPG rating correlated with the genre?
